I'm a co-founder of a [tech](http://github.com/Madadata/) [start-up](http://www.madadata.com/) in Beijing, China. We are focusing on building data platforms and solving hard data problems for our clients.

Personally I am a programmer and recently into functional programing - I've been learning Elixir and Haskell. I also use React for front-end code, Node/Java for back-end code, and Python for scripting.

I went to Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China, and then Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburg, USA, where my major focus were distributed systems. I once worked full-time in Morgan Stanley on high-frequency trading systems and as a full-stack software engineer intern in Palantir Technologies in Palo Alto.
